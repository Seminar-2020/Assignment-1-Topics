## Use this code skeleton to implement the deterministic MCD and the plug-in
## robust regression estimator.  Please submit your implementation together
## with your report.

## IMPORTANT: Please do not change any function names and make sure that you
##            use the correct input and output as specified for each function.
##            This will simplify grading because each group's code will be
##            similarly structured.  However, feel free to add other arguments
##            to the function definitions as needed.



## Functions for initial estimators

# Input: the standardized data matrix z
# Output: the estimated covariance or correlation matrix
# Please do not use any other input or output for the initial estimators

# correlation matrix based on the hyperbolic tangent
corHT <- function(z) {
  # *enter your code here*
}

# spearman correlation matrix
corSpearman <- function(z) {
  # *enter your code here*
}

# correlation matrix based on normal scores of the ranks
corNSR <- function(z) {
  # *enter your code here*
}

# modified spatial sign covariance matrix
covMSS <- function(z) {
  # *enter your code here*
}

# covariance matrix based on first step of BACON
covBACON1 <- function(z) {
  # *enter your code here*
}

# raw OGK estimator of the covariance matrix with median and Qn
rawCovOGK <- function(z) {
  # *enter your code here*
  # Hint: have a look at function covOGK() in package robustbase
}



## Main function for deterministic MCD algorithm

# Input:
# x ....... data matrix
# alpha ... proportion of observations to be used for subset size
# anything else you need

# Output
# A list with the following components:
# center ....... mean of the reweighted estimator
# cov .......... covariance matrix of the reweighted estimator
# weights ...... binary weights of the observations used for the reweighted
#                estimator (0 if outlier, 1 if used for estimation)
# raw.center ... mean of the raw estimator
# raw.cov ...... covariance matrix of the raw estimator
# best ......... indices of the observations in the best subset found by the
#                raw estimator
# any other output you want to return

covDetMCD <- function(x, alpha, ...) {
  # *enter your code here*
  #
  # Please note that the subset sizes for the MCD are not simply fractions of 
  # the number of observations in the data set, as discussed in the lectures.
  # You can use function h.alpha.n() from package robustbase to compute the 
  # subset size.
}



## Function for regression based on the deterministic MCD

# Input:
# x ........ matrix of explanatory variables
# y ........ response variable
# alpha .... proportion of observations to be used for the subset size in the 
#            MCD estimator
# anything else you need

# Output
# A list with the following components:
# coefficients .... estimated regression coefficients based on the reweighted
#                   deterministic MCD covariance matrix
# fitted.values ... fitted values for all observations in the data
# residuals ....... residuals for all observations in the data
# MCD ............. R object for the deterministic MCD (entire output from
#                   function covDetMCD())
# any other output you want to return

lmDetMCD <- function(x, y, alpha, ...) {
  # *enter your code here*
}
